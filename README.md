# Graph Saliency Maps through Spectral Convolutional Networks

The code in this repository provides the implementation of an activation-based visual attribution method for irregular graphs, which works integrated with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). The method has been validated via a sex clasification task using functional brain connectivity networks and data from the UK Biobank and is presented in our paper:

Here are the slides, poster (which has won the best poster award!) and a copy of the paper.
