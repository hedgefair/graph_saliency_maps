# Graph Saliency Maps through Spectral Convolutional Networks

The code in this repository provides the implementation of an activation-based visual attribution method for irregular graphs, which works integrated with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). The method has been validated via a sex classification task using functional brain connectivity networks and data from the [UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and is presented in our paper:

## Installation
1.  Clone this repository.
	```
    git clone https://github.com/sarslancs/graph_saliency_maps.git
    cd graph_saliency_maps
	```
   
2.  Install the dependencies. Please edit  `requirements.txt`  to choose the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) version (CPU / GPU, Linux / Mac) you need to install, or install it before attempting to use the code. 

	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt  # or make install
	```

3. The codebase is based on `Python 2.7.14, Anaconda custom (64-bit)`. We tested the code on `tensorflow 1.3.0` , `tensorflow-gpu 1.4.1`, and `tensorflow-tensorboard 0.1.8` on a workstation running `Ubuntu 16.04`. The CUDA version was `release 8.0, V8.0.61`. At the time of release, versions of other libraries were as follows: `numpy 1.12.1, sklearn 0.19.1, scipy 1.1.0, matplotlib 2.2.2`.
