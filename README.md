# Graph Saliency Maps through Spectral Convolutional Networks

The code in this repository provides the implementation of an activation-based visual attribution method for irregular graphs, which works integrated with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). The method has been validated via a sex classification task using functional brain connectivity networks and data from the [UK Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and is presented in our paper:
